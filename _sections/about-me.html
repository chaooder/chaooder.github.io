		<p>Having experienced various line of professions (e.g. military, manufacturing, etc.), I eventually found my passion with <i>data</i> about the time I left my role as a process engineer in 2017. Despite being trained in a different background (chemical engineering), the fascination in this exciting field supercharged my learning rate, and I have since gained professional experiences in the following areas - <strong><i>Data Engineering, Data Analyst, Software Development, Architecture Solutioning, Requirements Gathering, Project Management</i></strong>.</p>
		<p>I am passionate about building transformational digital landscapes leveraging game-changing advanced analytics, on top of highly performant & elastic data platforms, with unparalleled efficiencies in continuous integration/delivery. I am currently building expertise in machine learning and artificial intelligence.</p>
		<p>As a person, I seek the satisfaction from facing & overcoming challenges. Since a child, I have always been fascinated with science & technology, and this allows me to grasp new & complex technical concepts quickly. Aside from work, I enjoy taking photographs and exploring new places.</p>
